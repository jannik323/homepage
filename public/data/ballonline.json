"description":"A online racing game, which i made ,because i wanted to try making a multiplayer game with the socket.io package i found out about.<br><br>Worked pretty well,cheating was just very easy.<br><br>I might make a new version, now that i've got some more experience with backend programming and with node.js. That version will use the websockets without socket.io , as using that package might be unnecessary.(2023)",
