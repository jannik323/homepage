{"name":"Sorting Visualiser",
"description":"A Sorting visualiser i made in java, which, like the name implies, visualises different sorting alogorithm.<br><br>It's hardcoded to be a insertion-sort, but the program includes insertion,bubble,quick and selection-sort.<br><br>So if you want to view another sorting alogorithm, you will have to change the source code. I assume i had it this way, because i made it formyself, not thinking how others might use the program.<br><br>Edit (2023): Just added buttons for switching algorithms, unfortunatly quick-sort doesn't seem to work right and im too lazy to fix it.",
