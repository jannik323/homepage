"description":"A short javascript experiment i did, because i watched a video about b√©zier-curves.<br><br> You can change the degree in the source code, as i was too lazy to add any UI or settings on the website itself.<br>Should be in the setup() function. First four are position related and last one is degree.<br><br>You can move around nodes by just drag clicking them.",
