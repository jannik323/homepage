"description":"A funny web tower-defence game with lots of balls.<br><br>The game is pretty convoluted for a plain javascript game.It got a level editor,a bunch of maps,unlocks, endless mode,lots of differnt towers,fancy settings and cool funny sounds.<br>It might be a bit unoptimised , as it will run pretty slow (to be fair,there is a bunch of collision detection going on).But if you can sit that aside it can be pretty entertaining.<br><br>Loading in Maps is pretty easy, you just need to click \"Add Map\" and click \"Next Map\" until the imported map is selected.",
