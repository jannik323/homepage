"description":"Another game-jam game i've made.This one was for the gmtk2022 jam.<br><br>Unfortunately i had to remove it from the listing , as i had to update it after the time limit. The game was fully done a few hours before the deadline,but i had to leave on the day of the deadline and didnt check if the final build worked.Turns out the only feedback i'd get is that my game doesnt work.<br><br>Basically the menu canvas was set in the wrong mode and wasn't visible/reachable, because of that i had to remove it from the game jam.<br><br>It was still alot of fun to make and i think the game is pretty cool and fun to play.If you like grapples in games, this might be a game you like.",
