"description":"A game im making , heavily inspired by \"fragments of euclid\"by NuSan.<br><br>It got a look of antichamber, or so i've been told.This was also the first time i worked with shaders or rather made shaders.Pretty fun to play around with, but hard to do right.<br><br>The game only got a few levels and still got a few visual bugs.I've also lost motivation to work on it ,but ill continue someday.",
