"description":" My first game i made with Unity or at least the first actual finished game.\n\nI believe i did try out Unity before i made this game , but only to experiment.The game got its name and idea from Karlson (a game by dani).\n\n All the light is baked in , but badly. I believe i set the quality real low , because i didnt want to wait for so long. It kinda gives it a certain charm. The game has simmilar movement (but way floatier) ,like karlson(itch.io), but ive heard people say its more like re:run. \n\nI had fun making it, but got tired from making new levels after some time. Also big levels took very long to bake light and would sometimes crash my unity editor , because i thought it would be a good idea to merge all probuilder meshes together. (ofc not all , but you get the point)",
