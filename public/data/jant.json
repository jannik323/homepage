"description":"This is a clone of <a href='/projects/jlife'>jlife</a> that is simulating \"Langton's Ant\".<br><br>The two look pretty identical and that is because i hardly changed much. I just removed a lot, because this one doesn't need special types. It just needs ants...<br><br>I'd advice to just click \"Clear\" and then place a single ant. I'm not sure why i left in that randomness.",
