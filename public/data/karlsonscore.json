"description":"This website gets a speedrunners's best times of all categories and calculates a score out of them compared to the best possible time. It also has a comparison section to compare runners best IL times and fullgame times.<br><br>I mainly made this ,because davetheepic04 made something simmilar, but in a google doc, which isnt as flexible and customisable as this is.<br><br>An important thing to mention is, that the score table is empty at the beginning, so that the user can decide themself who to have on the score list.There is also a \"Add Top Players\" button for the lazy people, that just wanna see the best times.(These are just the best fullgame players, not best score)<br><br>The scores get cached in the users localstorage and will be updated automatically after a set time.",
