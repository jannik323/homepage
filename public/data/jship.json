"description":"Space exploration and spaceship builder game.<br><br> You can create and fly around with self-made spaceships. Mine resources with a laser and buy more parts and expand your spaceship more.The game is in a working state ,but i lost interest at one point and stopped working on it further.<br><br>I might touch it up a little and just release it as it is, but i dont know yet.<br><br>Oh and i almost forgot the coolest part:\nlogic gates and wires -> you can connect pretty much all interactive parts with sensors and logic gates and in theory build a calculator in the game itself.",
