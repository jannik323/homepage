"description":"A game made for the Mini Jam 106: FrogsÂ²m, which was also the first game jam i participated in.<br><br>The gameplay is pretty much a platformer with changing movement over time, but i must admit the water movement could be better.<br><br>I landed in Rank#60 with this game which is pretty good id say (use of the limitation #25 :O).The game jam was pretty fun to do and im sure i learned a few things, cause there are definetly things i would have done different.A Web-Build is also available on itch.io , but i would advice downloading the game.",
