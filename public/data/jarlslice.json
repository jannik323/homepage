"description":"Jarlslice was originally just a project to try out mesh slicing, which is one of the primary things you do in the game.\n\nAfter working on the project for a while i decided to turn it into \"jarlson 2\", but i didnt't want to name it \"jarlson 2\".\nSo jarlson + slice = jarlslice... i know , how creative :P.I think the game is a big step up from jarlson , since it got so many new features and is just overall better.The two games don't really have too much simmilar , other than having the same core idea and having some modified karlson movement code.\n\nI've updated the game quite a few times , adding a leveleditor and multiplayer. Both of them are a little limited,but work and are really fun to play.",
