{"name":"Jblocker Level Editor",
"description":"This is a simple level editor for <a href='/projects/jblocker'>jblocker</a> which can be used instead of using any other image manipulation software.<br><br>The main difference over this and using ms-paint is that all the correct colors are already pre-defined.I also just wanted to create my own \"level editor\", even if its just a weird pixelart creator.<br><br>The only problem i had was saving the images , because the html canvas , which i used for painting , would not save all the colors 100% accurate (slightly different). Which isnt a problem normally, but jblocker needs the <b>exact</b> right color for it to work.",
