"description":"JBlock is a platformer game in which levels are saved as simple pngs.<br><br>I also created a dedicated <a href='/projects/jblockerleveleditor'>level editor</a> which is just a weird web-based ms-paint with predefined colors.I made this because i thought the idea of creating levels with just an image would be easy to pick up and use. Which it was , but making them was a little confusing to people, even if they just needed ms-paint.<br><br>I think i made this after i made <a href='/projects/jdungeon'>JDungeon</a> , but it might just be the other way around...<br><br>Either way they both use parts of the same system to spawn in levels.",
