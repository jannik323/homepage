"description":"A 3D dungeon crawler , rouge-lite or whatever you wanna call it.<br><br>My inspiration was the game \"The Binding of Isaac\" which i quite like.The game got a bunch of cool features and around 24 Items.If you have played \"The Binding of Isaac\" before you will recognize some of the mechanics.Figuring out the room generation was a lot of work and im pretty sure there is still some game breaking bug out there, but afaik the game works as it should.<br><br>On a sidenote , the game is pretty hard, so dont get confused why you can't even clear one floor.",
